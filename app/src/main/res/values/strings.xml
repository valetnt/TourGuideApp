    <string name="activity_main_description">
        The city of Padua (in Italian: Padova) is considered by many to be one of the most
        beautiful cities in Northern Italy.
        Less than 40 km away from Venice,
        Padua has little to envy to its much more famous neighbour and can boast an
        equally rich history and an equally fascinating patrimony of art and architecture.
        Moreover, the city hosts one of the most ancient universities in the world.
        Most of Padua\&#39;s historical sites, museums and monuments are located in the city center,
        but the countryside has plenty to offer as well, with its medieval towns, castles
        and luxurious villas.
        Here is a list of the major attractions that you can find in the city
        and its surroundings.
