    <string name="activity_main_description">
        The city of Padua (in Italian: Padova) is considered by many to be one of the most
        beautiful cities in Northern Italy.
        Less than 40 km away from Venice,
        Padua has in fact little to envy to her much more famous neighbour and can boast an
        equally rich history and an equally fascinating patrimony of art and architecture.
        Moreover, the city hosts one of the most ancient Universities in the world.
        Here you will find a list of the major attractions that are really worth a visit if you
        happen to come into town.
